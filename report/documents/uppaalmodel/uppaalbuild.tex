\section{Choosing a Program Representation}
When translating a program to a Uppaal model, it is important to choose an appropriate representation of the program. Several representations are possible, depending on what one wants to show. One could for example represent a program merely in terms of program flow if a simulation of a disruption of the program flow is to be shown, e.g an error in the progrma counter. One could also model the data flow in the program if a simulation of a corruption of a memory value is to be shown. These are just a few examples and many representations can be chosen.\\

We have chosen the former and model the program in terms of program flow, so that we can simulation disruptions in the programs execution flow.
