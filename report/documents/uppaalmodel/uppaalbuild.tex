\section{Program Modelling}
\ch{adapt chapter to new title?}
When translating a program to a UPPAAL model, several approaches are possible, depending on what one wants to show. One could for example represent a program merely in terms of program flow if a simulation of a disruption of the program flow is to be shown, e.g an error in the program counter. One could include the data flow in the program if a simulation of a corruption of a memory value is to be shown. These are just a few examples and many representations can be chosen.\\

We have chosen the later and model the program in terms of program flow and data flow, so that we can simulation disruptions in the programs execution flow.
