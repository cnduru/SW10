\section{Program Modelling}
When translating a program to a UPPAAL model, several approaches are possible, depending on what is to be shown. One could for example represent a program merely in terms of program flow, if a disruption of program flow is to be simulated, e.g an error in the program counter. A memory corruption could be simulated by including the data flow in the model. These are just a few examples and many representations can be chosen. We have chosen the latter and model programs in terms of program and data flow to simulate disruptions in the execution flow.
