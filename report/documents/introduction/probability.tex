\section{Fault Probabilities}
As mentioned in \Cref{sec:faultsce}, the time a bit flip is performed, matter in terms of how much of the system can be affected. Logically, a greater attack surface equals a greater probability of affecting a piece of memory that will cause a desirable outcome for an attacker.


% install()
We have decided to not perform any simulation of bit flip attacks in the \texttt{install()} method\ch{the method should probably be explained in the platform section} and protection against these.
