The time at which a bit flip is performed, matters in terms of how much of the system can be affected, e.g. at run-time versus when a card is powered off. Logically, a greater attack surface equals a greater probability of affecting a piece of memory that will cause a desirable outcome for an attacker. An example could be a method which is only runs once compared to a method which might be called ten times. Assuming methods of similar size and memory usage, the second method would have a probability ten times the that of the method which is only called once, to be hit by a bit flip. It should be noted that even if a method has a greater probability of being hit by a bit flip, it is not guaranteed that there is a greater chance that the bit flip will bring the card into a situation compromising security. This depends on the nature of the method.\\\\
