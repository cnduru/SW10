Smart cards are found in many places today. Everywhere from SIM cards in phones, laundromat cards and credit cards. The first wide spread use of smart cards was french pay phone cards in 1983\cite[p. 366]{modbank}. In May 2011 Economic Interest Group noticed that smart cards stolen in France were being used in Belgium. It turned out a group of criminals, aided by an engineer, managed to perform a man-in-the middle attack on the credit cards by placing a chip on top of the original chip. The attack bypassed PIN verification by intercepting communication between a credit card terminal and the original chip. As a consequence, a transaction would be approved whether the correct PIN was entered on the terminal or not. The estimated damages of the gang's activities are estimated to be below \EUR{600,000}. The criminal gang sold items purchased with the stolen cards on the black market. They managed to exploit over 7,000 transactions before being apprehended.\\\\
% purpose of the report
This report shows that two selected attack countermeasures, code duplication and call graph integrity, improve the security of Java bytecode. Several models of a program are presented and tested by simulation in the modelling program UPPAAL, to assert that this is indeed true.
