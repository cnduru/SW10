This report is the result of a Master Thesis software engineering project at Aalborg University.\\

\noindent The aim of the report is to present a tool for converting Java bytecode into UPPAAL models, which in turn can be used to compare how vulnerable different programs are to fault injections, formalised by fault models. References are listed with numbers and not by the author’s name(s), e.g. [23]. Furthermore, whenever writing “we”, it refers to the project group and its members.\\

\noindent We would like to thank our supervisors for their guidance during the writing of this
report.
