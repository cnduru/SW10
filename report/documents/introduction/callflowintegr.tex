\paragraph{Call Flow Integrity} described by \cite{agl}, is a technique which allows a programmer to annotate code to denote sensitive regions. The programmer then inserts flags which increment a counter. It is also possible to insert verfication points where the counter is checked to verify the flag value. The idea is that if a change in the call graph occurs, e.g. a method call is skipped because of a fault in the program counter, the flag will have the wrong value.
