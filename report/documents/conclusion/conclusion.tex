\chapter{Conclusion}

%UPPAAL
	%quick and scaleable
	%hard to tell results apart

	
	%missing for the model
		%wordsize
		%data types
		%Array
		

%Experiments

	%Many small methods, seems safer but might be due to our fault models


\section{Future Work}

%inst fault, %Javacard inst bit encoding
%parameter fault etc

%multi path in program

\ch{mention how instruction fault could be modelled and why we haven't included it in our experiments (we didn't want to model the entire instruction set)}
