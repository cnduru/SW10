\section{Proposed Solution}
We propose a solution which can convert a Java class file into a UPPAAL SMC model,
modify the model to insert fault injection attacks and countermeasures, and assess the
effectiveness of these. The purpose of the conversion is to be able to provide guarantees 
that the program has not become less secure with the implemented countermeasures.\\\\
The workflow stages of the solution are illustrated in \cref{fig:workflow_new}. The stages are labelled with numbers 1-3. Their purposes are detailed in the following.

% burde vi også give mulighed i programmet for bare at få en ``vanilla'' SMC model ud?

\paragraph{Stage 1 - 2} parses Java bytecode through the solution's parser and generates a UPPAAL SMC model. This code can be either unmodified code or code implemented with countermeasures.  
\paragraph{Stage 2 - 3} assesses the attacks performed and countermeasures implemented, to evaluate vulnerability and countermeasure effectiveness.
