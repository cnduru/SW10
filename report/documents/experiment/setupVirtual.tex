The experiments are performed on the code sample from \cref{lst:virtual}, results for the code duplication countermeasure are omitted because the example has no branches. The purpose of the sample is to include virtual and special invokes, to be used in these experiments. Because of the invokes, heap and locals faults now have an impact, and are therefore included in the result table.\\\\
\ch{mention that exceptions are not caught so they show themselves as crashes in the results}
