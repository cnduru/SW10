% base
In the Base case, where no fault was introduced, the progam ran as expected.\\\\
% base + pc
In the case of Base + PC, interesting results emerge. In $10.8\% - 11.8\%$ of runs, a crash occurred. This happens when the operand stack becomes unaligned, e.g. because the program counter is changed to an address containing an instruction which consumes two stack elements, but the original instruction only consumes one.\\\\
% base + op
The results for Base + OP show that it is possible to perform a successful attack, but the probability is small at $< 1\%$.\\\\
