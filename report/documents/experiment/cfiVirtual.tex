% CFI + PC
%
For CFI + PC, the attack percentage is lower than that of CGI + PC, which indicates CFI is more effective at protecting against program counter faults. As a consequence, the crash probability is higher since an exception is thrown every time CFI detects a discrepancy in the call graph. Additionally, the extra instructions added by the countermeasure, result in more possibilities for the program counter fault to strike, but also increased possibility that the attack will cause an unaligned program counter value.\\\\
% CFI + OP

% better at pc than op fault
% flip in add value = crash
CFI + OP protects better against program counter faults than operand stack heap and local faults, but neither differentiate themselves in a significant way.
