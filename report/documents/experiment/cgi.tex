% cgi + pc
CGI + PC shows a higher vulnerability with a fault in the program counter, compared to the code duplication countermeasure. This is because the sensitive code region has become larger, as a result of additional instructions inserted to implement the countermeasure, thus resulting in a larger attack surface.\\\\
% cgi + op
As CGI + OP shows, though low at $\leq 1\%$, a successful attack is possible in CGI + OP, while it is not in CD + OP. The reason for this, is that the chance of a bit flip in the operand stack occurring at exactly the right time, at the right place in the operand stack is very small.
