% cgi + pc
CGI + PC shows a higher vulnerability with a fault in the program counter, compared to the code duplication countermeasure. This is likely because the sensitive code region has become larger, as a result of additional instructions inserted to implement the countermeasure, thus resulting in a larger attack surface.\\\\
% cgi + op
As CGI + OP shows a successful attack is possible, but it can not differentiated from Base + OP, as the probability for a successful attack is very small.
