% base
In the base case, no fault was introduced and as a result, the program ran as expected.\\\\
%
% base + pc
In Base + PC, the crash probability appear high which is likely because of misaligned program counter values.\\\\
%
% base + op
The probability of crashes in Base + OP are present because the sample uses the operand stack to a greater degree than the \jc Purse results, thus causing a larger attack surface.
%
% base + H + L
Results for Base + H and Base + L show detectable crash and attack probabilities, because the sample uses the heap for objects and local variables for storing calculation results.
