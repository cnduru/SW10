Generally, the CGI countermeasure did not work well on the code sample, and the probability of a successful attack appears to be greater than for the Base example. We attribute this to the fact that the CGI code size was twice as big as the Base, and as a consequence created a larger attack surface, while CFI added significantly less size overhead.
