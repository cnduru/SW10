CFI2 is a modification of the CFI example seen in \cref{lst:examplecfi}, which was our attempt\ch{replace authors with we} to reduce the attack probability.\\\\
% CFI2 + PC
As the results show in the case of CFI2 + PC, the modification is hard to separate from the attack probability of CFI + PC, and it had no discernible effect. A positive side effect, however, was a reduced crash probability, which is likely due to the fact that the largest method in CFI2 has fewer instructions than in CFI, and thus a smaller attack surface.\\\\
% CFI2 + OP
CFI2 + OP is similar to CFI + OP, but a very small amount of attacks were successful in the simulation runs. This amount is neglible, however.
