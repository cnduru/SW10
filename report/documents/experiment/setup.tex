The experiments will be tested according to two criteria, to determine whether a fault affecting security has happened

\begin{itemize}
\item The simulation can reach the main template's \textit{done} location without an exception occuring
\item The simulation can reach the main template's \textit{done} location without a operand stack fault happening
\end{itemize}
