% cd + pc
For CD + PC we expected a change in the attack probability compared to Base + PC, since the critical region of the code was offset, which might or might not have enabled new paths to be taken. The non-significant change in the results may be because the protected program happens to have the same amount of valid paths.\\\\
% cd + op
CD + OP successfully protects the code when it is subjected to a bit flip in the operand stack, as seen in the attack column. We attribute this to the fact that code that uses the operand stack, e.g. an \texttt{ifeq} instruction, is duplicated and therefore a flip in a value used, is overwritten with a correct value.
