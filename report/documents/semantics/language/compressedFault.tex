\ch{mention these rules in experiments}
\ch{descriptions?}
\ch{we should add more semantics for altered/new rules to make this table make sense}

\begin{tabular}{p{.35\textwidth}|p{.65\textwidth}}
\textbf{Rule} 					  & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
DATA\_FAULT             		  & Describes a change in the operand stack, local variables or the heap, caused by a bit flip.\\ \hline 
PROGRAM\_FLOW\_FAULT			  & Describes a change in the program flow or method identifier due to a bit flip. \\ \hline
INSTRUCTION\_FAULT				  & Describes a change from one instruction to another, caused by a bit flip. \\ \hline
