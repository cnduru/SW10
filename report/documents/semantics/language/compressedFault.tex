\subsection{Fault Models}
We use fault models to formalise how fault injections affect our modelled execution. A number of fault models describing how various bit flips can affect the execution were also defined. A summary can be seen in \cref{tab:fault} and the full definition can be seen in \cref{sec:semFault}. Each rule defines how a single bit flip will affect the program state. For multiple bit flips, a rule must be applied multiple times, but for the purpose of this report we will only focus on single bit flips.

\begin{tabular}{p{.35\textwidth}|p{.55\textwidth}}
\textbf{Rule} 					  & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
DATA\_FAULT             		  & Describes a change in the operand stack, local variables or the heap, caused by a bit flip.\\ \hline 
PROGRAM\_FLOW\_FAULT			  & Describes a change in the program flow or method identifier due to a bit flip. \\ \hline
INSTRUCTION\_FAULT				  & Describes a change from one instruction to another, caused by a bit flip. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
