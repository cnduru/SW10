\subsection{NOP}
%This instruction has no effect other than incremented $PC$ by one.
The instruction has no other effect than incrementing the $pc$.
%The no operation (NOP) instruction does nothing. Therefore only the program counter, $PC$, is incremented to point to the next instruction to be executed. Additionaly, it should also be checked whether the instruction we are currently executing is indeed a NOP. This is done with $inst(P, mid, pc) = \texttt{NOP}$\\

%This results in a changed program counter, but an unchanged stack. The operational semantics for the NOP instruction are then as follows:
%$$\inference[NOP]{PC' = PC + 1 \semsp inst(P, PC) = \texttt{NOP}}{CP, P \vdash \langle PC, S \rangle \Rightarrow \langle PC', S \rangle}$$\\

$$\inference[NOP]{inst(P, mid, pc) = \texttt{NOP}}

{CP, P \vdash \langle H, (CS, \langle mid, loc, ops, pc \rangle)\rangle \Rightarrow 
 \langle H, (CS, \langle mid, loc, ops, pc + 1 \rangle)\rangle
}$$

%{CP, P \vdash \langle PC, S \rangle \Rightarrow \langle PC', S \rangle}$$\\
