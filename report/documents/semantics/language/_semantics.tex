In this chapter, the semantics of \jcl and the fault models are briefly described. The full semantics can be seen in \cref{chap:semantics}, and are taken in full from from \cite{javasec}. We have made minor contributions to the semantics and thus extending them.

\section{Invoke}
``Virtual methods are instance methods that are resolved dynamically. The set includes all public, protected and package-visible instance methods. Private instance methods and all constructors are not virtual methods, but instead are resolved statically during compilation.'' \cite[cap. 4.3.7.6]{java_card_specc}
