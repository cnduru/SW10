\subsection{INVOKE\_STATIC}
\texttt{INVOKESTATIC} $mid$ is used to call a static method.
%This involves adding a new stack frame on the call stack with  locals which are the parameters taken by the method being the parameters taken by the method as well as local variables.
This involves adding a new stack frame on the call stack.
The parameters of the methods are stored in local variables of that stack frame.
These parameters are read from the operand stack.
The number of parameters, $pn$, are found in the constant pool. 

$$\inference[INVOKESTATIC]{
inst(P,mid,pc) = \texttt{INVOKESTATIC }mid' \semsp 
CP(mid') = pn \semnl \\
ops = (x_0, \ldots, x_n) \semsp
ops' = (x_0, \ldots, x_{n-pn}) \semnl\\
loc' = [0 \mapsto x_{n-pn}, \ldots, pn \mapsto x_n])}
{CP, P \vdash \langle H, (CS, \langle mid, loc, ops, pc \rangle)\rangle \Rightarrow }$$
$$\langle H, (CS, \langle mid, loc, ops', pc \rangle, \langle mid', loc', \epsilon, 0 \rangle)\rangle$$
