\subsection{INSTRUCTION\_FAULT}
A function, $flipInstruction$ is used to look up the instruction which an original, unaltered, instruction can be changed to by way of a bit flip. This function is defined as
$$flipInstruction \subset inst$$



This fault causes a change in an instruction, e.g. changing a \texttt{ADD} to a \texttt{POP} by changing a single bit in the instruction.

$$\inference[INST\_F]{
inst(P,mid, pc) = I \semsp
P \equiv_1 P' \semnl \\
I,I' \in Instructions \semsp
I' \neq I \semsp
flipInstruction(P',mid, pc) = I'
}
{\langle CP, P, H, (CS, \langle mid, loc, ops, pc \rangle) \rangle \Rightarrow \langle CP, P', H, (CS, \langle mid, loc, ops, pc \rangle)\rangle }$$
