\section{Property Verification}
UPPAAL has its own query language used to verify properties of a model\cite[p. 7]{upptut}. The language is a simplified version of timed computation tree logic. UPPAAL's query language consists of \textit{state formulae} and \textit{path formulae}. The path formulae can be categorised into three categories: reachability, safety and liveness. These are described below, and they are summarised in \cref{fig:query}.
\paragraph{State formulae}
A state formula is an expression which can be evaluated for a state, without looking at the mode, e.g. $i \geq 42$. This formula asks whether it is true that $i$ is greater than or equal to $42$ in a given state. State formulae also allow one to verify whether a process is in a given location using an expression of the form \texttt{P.l}, where \texttt{P} is a process and \texttt{l} is a location in the process.\\\\
%deadlock special case
A deadlock is described using a special state formula, \texttt{deadlock}, and is satisfied for all states which deadlock.
\paragraph{Reachability properties} express the notion that a state formula, $\varphi$, can \textit{possibly} be satisfied on some path, going from the initial location of the model. In UPPAAL it is expressed as \texttt{E<>$\varphi$}. This could for example be used to verify whether a variable \texttt{i} in the model, along some path going from the initial location will have the value $2$ by querying the model with \texttt{E<>i == 2}.\\\\
These types of properties are often verified as a part of a sanity check of a modelled system\cite[p. 205]{upptut}, e.g. that it is possible to reach the done location in a \jc program. Though this does not give any guarantee that the program will always finish, it makes sense to make sure to check whether it \textit{possibly} can.
\paragraph{Safety properties} state that ``something bad will never happen''. In other words, every state in a model will invariantly satisfy $\varphi$. This is useful e.g. to check that a bit flip can not cause a modelled program to end up in a location where e.g. incorrect credentials are authenticated and subsequently approved. Such an invariant safety property is expressed in UPPAAL as \texttt{A[]$\varphi$}, where the state formula, $\varphi$, would express that the simulation of the model would never end up in the approved location when the credentials are incorrect.\\\\
A variant of this safety property, is one that expresses that ``something will possibly never happen'', e.g. when playing a game, a safe state would be one where a winning move is always possible. This is expressed in UPPAAL as \texttt{E[]$\varphi$}, which states that there should exist a maximal path\footnote{A maximal path, is a path that is either infinite or the last state has no outgoing edges that can be traversed.}, where $\varphi$ is always true.
\paragraph{Liveness property} state that ``something will eventually happen'', e.g. verify that the program will eventually reach the end location. It is expressed in UPPAAL as \texttt{A<>$\varphi$}, and means that $\varphi$ is eventually satisfied.\\\\
A variation of this liveness property, is the \textit{leads to} property, written as $\varphi \leadsto \psi$. It is expressed in a UPPAAL query as \texttt{$\varphi$ --> $\psi$}, and means that if $\varphi$ is satisfied, $\psi$ will eventually be satisfied, e.g. when \jc transaction is begun, it will eventually end\footnote{A transaction in respect to \jc, is a number of instructions which should be executed atomically.}.
