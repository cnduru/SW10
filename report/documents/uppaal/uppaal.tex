\chapter{UPPAAL and Formal Verification}
\section{Property Verification}
UPPALL has its own query language used to verify properties of a model\cite[p. 7]{upptut}. The language is a simplified version of timed computation tree logic. UPPAAL's query language consists of \textit{state formulae} and \textit{path formulae}. The path formulae can be categorised into three categories: reachability, safety and liveness.

\paragraph{State formulae}

\paragraph{Reachability properties} express the notion that a state formulae, $\varphi$, can \textit{possibly} be satisfied on some path, going from the initial location of the model. In UPPAAL it is expressed as \texttt{E<>$\varphi$}. This could for example be used to verify whether a variable \texttt{i} in the model, along some path going from the initial location will have the value $2$ by querying the model with \texttt{E<>i == 2}.\\\\
These types of properties are often verified as a part of a sanity check of a modelled system\cite[p. 8]{upptut}. For example, when modelling a communication protocol, one can verify that a sender will be able to send a message and that a receiver will be able to receive a message, at some point. Though this does not give any guarantee that a message is always delivered or received, it makes sense to make sure to check whether it eventually \textit{can} be.
\paragraph{Safety properties} state that ``something bad will never happen''. In other words, every state in a model will invariantly satisfy $\varphi$. This is useful e.g. if one had created a model of a train track network, and two trains should never be at the same crossing at the same time. Such an invariant safety property is expressed in UPPAAL as \texttt{A[]$\varphi$}, where the state formulae, $\varphi$, would express that the two trains are never at the same crossing at the same time.\\\\
A variant of this safety property, is one that expresses that ``something will possibly never happen'', e.g. when playing a game, a safe state would be one where a winning move is always possible. This is expressed in UPPAAL as \texttt{E[]$\varphi$}, which states that there should exist a maximal path\footnote{A maximal path, is a path that is either infinite or the last state has no outgoing edges that can be traversed.}, where $\varphi$ is always true.
\paragraph{Liveness property} state that ``something will eventually happen''. This could for example be that when a coffee maker is turned on, it will eventually output coffee. It is expressed in UPPAAL as \texttt{A<>$\varphi$}, and means that $\varphi$ is eventually satisfied.\\\\
A variation of this liveness property, is the \textit{leads to} property, written as $\varphi \leadsto \psi$. It is expressed in a UPPAAL query as \texttt{$\varphi$ --> $\psi$}, and means that if $\varphi$ is satisfied, $\psi$ will eventually be satisfied, e.g. whenever a message has been sent, it will eventually be received.
