\chapter{UPPAAL and Formal Verification}
\section{Property Verification}
UPPALL has its own query language used to verify properties of a model\cite[p. 7]{upptut}. The language is a simplified version of timed computation tree logic. UPPAAL's query language consists of \textit{state formulae} and \textit{path formulae}. The path formulae can be categorised into three categories: reachability, safety and liveness.

\paragraph{State formulae}

\paragraph{Reachability properties}
Reachability properties express the notion that a property, $\varphi$, can \textit{possibly} be satisfied on some path, going from the initial location of the model. In UPPAAL it is expressed as \texttt{E<>$\varphi$}. This could for example be used to verify whether a variable \texttt{i} in the model, along some path going from the initial location will have the value $2$ by querying the model with \texttt{E<>i == 2}.\\\\
These types of properties are often verified as a part of a sanity check of a modelled system\cite[p. 8]{upptut}. For example, when modelling a communication protocol, one can verify that a sender will be able to send a message and that a receiver will be able to receive a message, at some point. Though this does not give any guarantee that a message is always delivered or received, it makes sense to make sure to check whether it eventually \textit{can} be.
