%SW7 ABSTRACT
%The purpose of this project is to develop a system that is able to retrieve and distribute news articles crawled from external news providers such as NY Times and BBC.
%It can thus be characterized as a content curator, as it is able to retrieve, manipulate and present the crawled articles to users in the context of a web application.
%Content curation is enabled by implementing a recommender system that is able to suggest recommended articles to users by using collaborative filtering, while also considering the cold-start problem when no information about the user is know.
%Recommendations are computed in context of like-minded users and interests extracted from a social network profile.
%Retrieval is achieved through a crawler that observes a selected number of RSS feeds from many different providers.
%Whenever a new article is found from a feed, its content is manipulated through a series of steps that e.g. extracting content relevant to the domain and also classifying the content using text classification.
%After manipulating an article it is stored to enable a web application to distribute the articles to users.
