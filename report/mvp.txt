A solution which can:
* take a Java Byte Code program's annotated source code and a fault model as input
	* annotations indicate sensitive code regions which should be protected
* parse the annotated source code
* implement 2 different countermeasures and generate a UPPAAL SMC model
* recommend one of the two countermeasures for each annotated code section, based on a 
 statistical weighing of the protection provided vs. the perceived overhead, e.g. size og performance
